# Reference Field â€“ Contentstack Extension 

#### About this extension
The Reference field custom extension allows you to fetch entries from multiple content types of your stack into a field of your content type. Using this extension, you can define fields that refer to content from other content types as entries in your custom fields. It allows you to access and use entries from the referenced content types as inputs within your field.

Additionally, the Reference field extension also allows you to add raw queries to get specific entries as required. These queries should be added as config parameters while setting up the extension.
